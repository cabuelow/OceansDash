# Oceans Monitoring, Evaluation & Learning Dashboard

The Oceans Dashboard displays indicator time-series data to monitor progress towards goals for nature, people, and climate.

## Installation

If you wish to run the Oceans Dashboard offline, you can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) using:

``` r
devtools::install_github("cabuelow/OceansDash")
```

and run the application using:

``` r
library(OceansDash)
run_app()
```

Please note however, that the above download and installation is not required if you simply want to use the Oceans Dashboard. The latest version will always be available on the [Shiny Server](https://cbuelow.shinyapps.io/OceansDash/)

## Development TODO

- Finish WWF updates

- Get real data and integrate

- Start drafting manual for updating, etc.
