# Oceans Montioring Evaluation & Learning Dashboard

The Oceans Dashboard displays indicator time-series to monitor progress
towards goals for nature, people, and climate.

## Installation

If you wish to run the Oceans Dashboard offline, you can install the
development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) using:

``` r
devtools::install_github("cabuelow/OceansDash")
```

and run the application using:

``` r
library(OceansDash)
run_app()
```

Please note however, that the above download and installation is not
required if you simply want to use the Oceans Dashboard. The latest
version will always be available on the [Shiny Server]()
