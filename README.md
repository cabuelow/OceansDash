# Oceans Monitoring, Evaluation & Learning Dashboard

The Oceans Dashboard displays indicator time-series data to monitor
progress towards goals for nature, people, and climate.

## Installation

If you wish to run the Oceans Dashboard offline, you can install the
development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) using:

``` r
devtools::install_github("cabuelow/OceansDash")
```

and run the application using:

``` r
library(OceansDash)
run_app()
```

Please note however, that the above download and installation is not
required if you simply want to use the Oceans Dashboard. The latest
version will always be available on the [Shiny
Server](https://cbuelow.shinyapps.io/oceans-dashboard-prototype_v2/)

## Development TODO

- Finish WWF updates

- Get real data

- Start drafting manual for updating, etc.
